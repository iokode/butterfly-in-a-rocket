# Butterfly in a Rocket

## What is Buttefly?
[Butterfly](https://github.com/iokode/butterfly) (hereafter *Legacy Butterfly*) was the blogging engine of IOKode written in dotnet.
*Butterfly in a Rocket* is the version of this engine written in [Astro](https://astro.build).
The reasons for rewriting it using Astro can be found in [this blog post (in Spanish)](https://iokode.blog/post/butterfly-rocket).

The name comes from the original engine, *Butterfly*, and the space lore of *Astro*.

## Blog content
While *Astro* works better with the content next to the source code, I merged it in the same repository, so *Butterfly in a Rocket*
now lives in the *blog* repository. The content is located in the [content](https://github.com/iokode/blog/tree/main/src/content) directory.

In *Legacy Butterfly*, this repository only had the posts in the GitHub Discussions section. Now, this section only holds the
comments, but the post are in the repository as markdown files, allowing others to [collaborate](https://iokode.blog/collaborating) by sending pull requests.
