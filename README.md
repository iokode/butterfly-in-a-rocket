# Butterfly in a Rocket
[Butterfly](https://github.com/iokode/butterfly) (hereafter *Legacy Butterfly*) was the blogging engine of IOKode written in dotnet.
*Butterfly in a Rocket* is the version of this engine written in [Astro](https://astro.build).
The reasons for rewriting it using Astro can be found in [this blog post](https://iokode.blog/post/butterfly-rocket).

The name comes from the original engine, *Butterfly*, and the space lore of *Astro*.
